Why is the throttling at the sender level?
- While throttling is necessary so that we don't record too many readings, throttling in the sender is nice
  to the network. In the special case that an arduino sending over UDP bypasses python-based senders and thus
  bypasses the sender throttling mechanism, we may want to add throttling to the UDP receiver. Throttling is
  not at the provider level because the arduino may not have throttling (well, I haven't written throttling
  yet in the arduino) and we need to have it somewhere
